h1. Alchemist

Doing conversions for you so you don't have to google them and making code more readable.  

Having code that looks like this is meaningless

<pre>miles = 8 * 1609.344</pre>

You could add comments

<pre>miles = 8 * 1609.344 # converting meters to miles</pre>

But why not have this!

<pre>8.meters.to.miles</pre>

You can even perform mathematical operations

<pre>10.kilometers + 1.mile # 11.609344 kilometers</pre>
